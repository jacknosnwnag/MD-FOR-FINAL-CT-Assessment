# Brainstorming : 1. A bus thats trying to get to the end of the level, similar to the part A unity game
#                 2. Perhaps an entity training to chase the bus, or main character
#                 3. Obstacles that the bus has to go over 
#                 4. 
# Identifying a Need: 
##### Helping young children improve hand eye coordination through an entertaining, interactive and heart racing game that can promote focus and thinking on the spot.

# Problem Statement: 
##### Young chidren learn best through entertaining and interactive teaching methods such as games. Through this, they can learn hand eye coordination and thinking on the spot. A platformer game where players are being chased will help children learn how to think on the spot and improve their hand - eye coordination while having fun.
