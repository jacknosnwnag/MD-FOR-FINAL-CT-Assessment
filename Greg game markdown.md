# Brainstorming : 1. A bus thats trying to get to the end of the level, similar to the part A unity game
#                 2. Perhaps an entity training to chase the bus, or main character
#                 3. Obstacles that the bus has to go over 
#                   
# Identifying a Need: 
##### Helping young children improve hand eye coordination through an entertaining, interactive and heart racing game that can promote focus and thinking on the spot.

# Problem Statement: 
##### Young chidren learn best through entertaining and interactive teaching methods such as games. Through this, they can learn hand eye coordination and thinking on the spot. A platformer game where players are being chased will help children learn how to think on the spot and improve their hand - eye coordination while having fun.

# Skill development 
##### To develop the skills neccesary for this task, I will follow tutorials for 2D on Unity Learn.
# Inputs
##### - WASD = Movement keys (W for jump) 
##### - Click = Select
# Processing 
##### The program will check for collisions and calculate the new position of the player 
# Outputs 
##### The game will display the characters position, a welcome screen, a game over message, and displays what level they are on.
# Transmission
##### The game will require sending speed score data to an online leaderboard.
# Storage
##### The game will store the user's fastest time locally as a high score on the welcome screen.
# User interaction
##### The user will interact with the game through the keyboard and mouse 
# User actions
##### The user will be able to move the character around and start and end the game 
# Core actions of my project
##### The core  action of my project will be movement
# Scoring and Feedback
##### The game will have a high score for how fast the player can complete the game that will save when the player completes the game.
# Level progression
##### Users pass through the levels by reaching the end of the obstacle course without dying.
# Saving and Loading Data
##### High score time will be saved locally on the users device
